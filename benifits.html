<h1>5 Little Known Benefits of Drinking Water</h1>
<img src="water.jpeg" width="1000" height="500">
<p>The benefits of drinking water have been much discussed in the media.<br> Water helps keep you hydrated, which is important because every single cell in your body needs<br> it in order to absorb nutrients and expel waste products.<br> But what are some of the less well known benefits of drinking water?<p>
<h1>1) Drinking Water Keeps You Young</h1>
<p>Drinking plenty of water is great for your skin. If you don't drink enough water, you'll suffer from dry skin, and ,<br> you'll be likely to use more creams and lotions to moisturize. However, creams and lotions don't strike at the <br>root of the problem. Drinking plenty of water keeps your skin moisturized and reduces the appearance of fine <br> lines and wrinkles.
<p>If you don't drink enough water, your body will try to retain it in order to conserve resources<br>. This retention makes your skin puffy and can even lead to bloating.</p>
<h1>2) Drinking Water Helps You Lose Weight</h1>

<p>There's a reason why most diets and fitness programs ask you to drink a lot of water. One of the benefits of drinking water is that it helps you lose weight.

Water suppresses your appetite, so you don't eat as much. Drinking plenty of water also prevents fluid retention, because your body won't try to retain water if it's getting enough.

Drinking water also helps your body burn stored fat. If you're not drinking enough water, your liver will be forced to help your kidneys detoxify your body. When you drink plenty of water, your kidneys don't need any extra help, so your liver will be able to metabolize stored fat more efficiently. Drinking water flushes toxins from your body and prevents constipation.</p>
<h1>3) Drinking Water Helps You Build Muscle</h1>

<p>Another benefit of drinking water is that it makes your muscles stronger. That's because water carries oxygen to the cells of your body, including those of your muscles. Drinking plenty of water enables your muscles to work harder and longer before they feel tired, and this can help you build muscle.<p>

<h1>4) Drinking Water Makes You Smarter</h1>

<p>Drinking water can increase your cognitive function. Your brain needs a lot of oxygen in order to function at optimum levels. Drinking plenty of water ensures that your brain gets all the oxygen it needs. Drinking eight to ten cups of water per day can improve your levels of cognitive performance by as much as 30%!

Drinking plenty of water also supports nerve function. It ensures that your body's electrolyte levels remain high enough to allow your nerves to relay messages to and from the brain in the way they were meant to.<p>

<h1>5) Drinking Water Is Good for Your Joints</h1>

<p>One of the lesser known benefits of drinking water is that it helps keep your joints strong, healthy and lubricated. Your joints need moisture in order to remain strong and flexible, so that your movements are smooth and pain free.</p>

<h1>7 Science-Based Health Benefits of Drinking Enough Water</h1>
</center>
<p>The human body comprises around 60% water.<br></p>
<br>

<p>It’s commonly recommended that you drink eight 8-ounce (237-mL) glasses of water per day (the 8×8 rule).<br></p>
<br>

<p>Although there’s little science behind this specific rule, staying hydrated is important.<br></p>
<br>

<p>Here are 7 evidence-based health benefits of drinking plenty of water.</p>
<center><img src="glass.jpej.jfif" width="250" height="250"></center>
<h1>>1. Helps maximize physical performance</h1
<p>If you dont stay hydrated, your physical performance can suffer.

This is particularly important during intense exercise or high heat.

Dehydration can have a noticeable effect if you lose as little as 2% of your body’s water content. However, it isn’t uncommon for athletes to lose as much as 6–10% of their water weight via sweat (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).

This can lead to altered body temperature control, reduced motivation, and increased fatigue. It can also make exercise feel much more difficult, both physically and mentally (3).

Optimal hydration has been shown to prevent this from happening, and it may even reduce the oxidative stress that occurs during high intensity exercise. This isn’t surprising when you consider that muscle is about 80% water (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).

If you exercise intensely and tend to sweat, staying hydrated can help you perform at your absolute best.
</p>
SUMMARY
Losing as little as 2% of your body’s water content can significantly impair your physical performance.

<h1>2. Significantly affects energy levels and brain function
Your brain is strongly influenced by your hydration status.</h1>

<p>Studies show that even mild dehydration, such as the loss of 1–3% of body weight, can impair many aspects of brain function.

In a study in young women, researchers found that fluid loss of 1.4% after exercise impaired both mood and concentration. It also increased the frequency of headaches (6Trusted Source).

Many members of this same research team conducted a similar study in young men. They found that fluid loss of 1.6% was detrimental to working memory and increased feelings of anxiety and fatigue (7).

A fluid loss of 1–3% equals about 1.5–4.5 pounds (0.5–2 kg) of body weight loss for a person weighing 150 pounds (68 kg). This can easily occur through normal daily activities, let alone during exercise or high heat.

Many other studies, with subjects ranging from children to older adults, have shown that mild dehydration can impair mood, memory, and brain performance (8, 9Trusted Source, 10, 11Trusted Source, 12, 13).</p>

SUMMARY
Mild dehydration (fluid loss of 1–3%) can impair energy levels, impair mood, and lead to major reductions in memory and brain performance.

<h1>3. May help prevent and treat headaches</h1>
<p></p>Dehydration can trigger headaches and migraine in some individuals (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).

Research has shown that a headache is one of the most common symptoms of dehydration.

What’s more, some studies have shown that drinking water can help relieve headaches in those who experience frequent headaches.

A study in 102 men found that drinking an additional 50.7 ounces (1.5 liters) of water per day resulted in significant improvements on the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life scale, a scoring system for migraine symptoms (16).

Plus, 47% of the men who drank more water reported headache improvement, while only 25% of the men in the control group reported this effect (16).

However, not all studies agree, and researchers have concluded that because of the lack of high quality studies, more research is needed to confirm how increasing hydration may help improve headache symptoms and decrease headache frequency (17Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Drinking water may help reduce headaches and headache symptoms. However, more high quality research is needed to confirm this potential benefit.


<h1>4. May help relieve constipation</h1>
Constipation is a common problem that’s characterized by infrequent bowel movements and difficulty passing stool.

Increasing fluid intake is often recommended as a part of the treatment protocol, and there’s some evidence to back this up.

Low water consumption appears to be a risk factor for constipation in both younger and older individuals (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).

Increasing hydration may help decrease constipation.

Mineral water may be a particularly beneficial beverage for those with constipation.

Studies have shown that mineral water that’s rich in magnesium and sodium improves bowel movement frequency and consistency in people with constipation (20Trusted Source, 21).

SUMMARY
Drinking plenty of water may help prevent and relieve constipation, especially in people who generally don’t drink enough water.

<p>5. May help treat kidney stones</p>
Urinary stones are painful clumps of mineral crystal that form in the urinary system.

The most common form is kidney stones, which form in the kidneys.

There’s limited evidence that water intake can help prevent recurrence in people who have previously gotten kidney stones (22, 23).

Higher fluid intake increases the volume of urine passing through the kidneys. This dilutes the concentration of minerals, so they’re less likely to crystallize and form clumps.

Water may also help prevent the initial formation of stones, but studies are required to confirm this.

SUMMARY
Increased water intake appears to decrease the risk of kidney stone formation.

<h1>6. Helps prevent hangovers</h1>
A hangover refers to the unpleasant symptoms experienced after drinking alcohol.

Alcohol is a diuretic, so it makes you lose more water than you take in. This can lead to dehydration (24, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).

Although dehydration isn’t the main cause of hangovers, it can cause symptoms like thirst, fatigue, headache, and dry mouth.

Good ways to reduce hangovers are to drink a glass of water between drinks and have at least one big glass of water before going to bed.

SUMMARY
Hangovers are partly caused by dehydration, and drinking water can help reduce some of the main symptoms of hangovers.

<h1>7. Can aid weight loss</h1>
Drinking plenty of water can help you lose weight.

This is because water can increase satiety and boost your metabolic rate.

Some evidence suggests that increasing water intake can promote weight loss by slightly increasing your metabolism, which can increase the number of calories you burn on a daily basis.

A 2013 study in 50 young women with overweight demonstrated that drinking an additional 16.9 ounces (500 mL) of water 3 times per day before meals for 8 weeks led to significant reductions in body weight and body fat compared with their pre-study measurements (27Trusted Source).

The timing is important too. Drinking water half an hour before meals is the most effective. It can make you feel more full so that you eat fewer calories (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).

In one study, dieters who drank 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water before meals lost 44% more weight over a period of 12 weeks than dieters who didn’t drink water before meals (30Trusted Source).

People tend to drink a cup of coffee when they are looking for a mental performance boost. However, what they do not understand is that taking a glass of water is more beneficial to your brain than taking a cup of coffee. With 73-percent of your brain made up of water, drinking water regularly helps you focus, think, concentrate, and stay alert.

Moreover, studies have shown that being dehydrated by just two-percent affects your performance in tasks that require psychomotor, attention, and immediate memory skills. Dehydration negatively affects your brainpower by reducing your cognitive and motor skills, increase your sensitivity to pain, reduce your memory power and affect your mood.

<h1>12. Prevents headaches</h1>
Dehydration causes headaches, and this is because of the influence of dehydration on brain function. In other words, water is an essential component in the functionality of your brain. In addition to boosting brainpower, drinking water also helps to prevent and relieve headaches caused by dehydration.

According to Medical News Today, dehydration headache occurs when your body loses essential fluids affecting brain functionality. When dehydration occurs, the brain loses essential fluids resulting in a temporary shrink. The shrink causes the brain to pull away from the skull causing pain!

<h1>13. Prevents cramps and sprains</h1>
